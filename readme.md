Pytorch version
===============
This fork of Spinning Up uses only Pytorch (>=1.0) for all code implementations.

The principals behind the converted codes are similar to the original OpenAI's vision:

- Code is well structured and follow the templates when possible.
- Favor simplicity and focus on the RL algorithms over obscure software engineering practices and clever optimization.

Currently only code files will be converted. In the future, the tutorial will be also be updated with Pytorch code sample.

*Contributions and Pull Requests are welcomed.*

**Big thank to OpenAI and @jachiam for this**

Welcome to Spinning Up in Deep RL! 
==================================

This is an educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

For the unfamiliar: [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) (RL) is a machine learning approach for teaching agents how to solve tasks by trial and error. Deep RL refers to the combination of RL with [deep learning](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/).

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- a short [introduction](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/rl_intro.html) to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
- an [essay](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/spinningup.html) about how to grow into an RL research role,
- a [curated list](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/keypapers.html) of important papers organized by topic,
- a well-documented [code repo](https://github.com/openai/spinningup) of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,
- and a few [exercises](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/spinningup/exercises.html) to serve as warm-ups.
